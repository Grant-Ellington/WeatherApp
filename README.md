## Introduction

This project is a timed quiz. It is part of a coding boot camp. The time quiz has a time setting. To see featured part of the code reference 'What was Accomplished.

## Techonologiesasdfasdfa
Project is created with:
*HTML5
*CSS6
*JavaScript
## Set-up
To run, you can either clone the repo and run or go to via browser [https://grant-ellington.github.io/PasswordGenerator/](https://grant-ellington.github.io/PasswordGenerator/)
## What was accomplished
* a password generator that can create a password based on user inputs of specific combinations of charcters charcter types (ie. Capitol Letters, Lower case Letters, numbers, and special charcters)
* The password can also be any length with the max length being the length of a string allowed in java Script; 2,147,647 charcters.
* Will will cancel generation process if proper chacters are not defined.

###Functions created

#### genPassword Function

The genPassword function wroks buy first setting the Length by creating prompt. The char variable is also determind by user input. Then the for loop runs and pul;l a random number correlating to the place in the string of the charSel. It then builds a sting with the sub.string command until the loop is finnished giving a purely randomized order of the charcters given.

### charSel Function

The below function builds the string that the fenPassword function uses. It goes through all avaible chooses of types of charcters. The window.confirm saves these variables as a boolean statement. The if else then check the the truthy and falsy propperties determining the char variable for gen function by concating the var strings above.
